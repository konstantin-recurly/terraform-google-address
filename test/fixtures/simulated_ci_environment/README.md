# Integration Testing

Use this directory to create resources reflecting the same resource fixtures
created for use by the CI environment CI integration test pipelines.  The intent
of these resources is to run the integration tests locally as closely as
possible to how they will run in the CI system.

Once created, store the service account key content into the
`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.  This reflects the same behavior as
used in CI.

For example:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform output service_account_private_key > ~/.credentials/address-sa.json
```

Then, configure the environment (suggest using direnv) like so:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH="${HOME}/.credentials/address-sa.json"
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="${HOME}/.credentials/address-sa.json"
export TF_VAR_project_id="address-module"
export TF_VAR_region="us-west1"
```

With these variables set, change to the root of the module and execute the `make test_integration` task.
This make target is the same that is executed by this module's CI pipeline during integration testing.
